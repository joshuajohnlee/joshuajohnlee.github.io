    <section id="aboutme">
        <p>Hello! My name's Joshua, and I'm an I.T. student currently studying towards a bachelors degree in Computing and IT (Communications and Networking). Originally, I studied and got a Masters degree in French at the University of Glasgow, however after a career break and a change in direction I decided to follow my passion for IT. During this time, I decided to focus on networking, as it is an area that really interests me.</p>

        <p>
            In my study of networking, I have been learning using Cisco's NetAcad. So far, I have completed the <a href="./assets/netacad-course-cert.pdf">Networking Essentials course</a> which gives me basic knowledge of building simple LANs, IPv4/IPv6 addressing, the Cisco IOS command line, basic network security and other topics.
        </p>

        <p>
            In future modules, I will pursue more advanced NetAcad modules. Once I have covered the necessary topics and have a good amount of knowledge, I intend on pursuing my CCNA certification.
